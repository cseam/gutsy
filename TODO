DONE print (current, move to debug option -d|debug)
save results to specified file (otherwise results) -r|results=s
download with curl -c
download with wget -w
use local file -l|local=s

Other todo in order of how easy it would probably be
parse out url for the link to the thread
results into a html document (would be super basic)
parse urls/emails in text
location data (can use Geography::USStates and Geography::Countries, regex will be annoying, but would be cool)
include top level comment count (useful to check for updates)
