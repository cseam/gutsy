Scribd (YC '06), San Francisco - H1B, FULL-TIME, and INTERN are all welcome
Scribd (social publishing &#38; eBooks, top 100 website, 35 people) is hiring talented hackers and other technical people for a broad range of technologies.
We've hired FIVE full-time people and TWO summer interns from these "Who is Hiring" threads, including one just last month ... it really works!!
We're looking for people who want to work with:
* Ruby on Rails (we're the #2 largest rails site, after Twitter)
* Javascript (we recently switched to Coffeescript and are loving it)
* iOS
* Machine Learning / data mining / recommendations
* Back-end problems: scalability, web crawling, big data, analytics
* DevOps and web infrastructure
That said, we care way more about your personality and general hacking skills then what languages you've used so far, so if you haven't used these but want to break into mobile or web development, this could be a good opportunity for you. We've hired people from these threads with everywhere from 0 to 10 years of experience. We're profitable, very well funded and have a really fun office environment (go-karts + a rock climbing wall!). We've got flexible hours, a very engineer-driven company culture, and a really terrific team.
Scribd alumni have gone on to found 4 other YCombinator companies, more than from any other startup. We think this says something about the kind of people that we like to hire.
We are always looking for international people interested in moving to the US and can help you secure a visa.

Cambridge, MA - CustomMade (<a href="http://www.custommade.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.custommade.com/</a>) INTERN, REMOTE (possibly)
Full-time django / python dev, likely onsite, possible remote. Also looking for frontend guys who know backbone / jquery et al. Boilerplate here: <a href="http://www.custommade.com/careers/" rel="nofollow">http://www.custommade.com/careers/</a>
We're a two-sided marketplace that does matchmaking between professional artisans / craftsmen and buyers. You post your dreams, we find someone to make it real. People come up with some crazy ideas like a custom made quidditch set / proposal ring: <a href="http://blog.custommade.com/portfolio/a-very-harry-potter-proposal/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.custommade.com/portfolio/a-very-harry-potter-pro...</a>
We're funded by Google Ventures and a ton of others: <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/custommade-ventures" rel="nofollow">http://www.crunchbase.com/company/custommade-ventures</a> So paying you well is not an issue.
We're right at the point where all the graphs are hockey-stick shaped and we're breaking our own records every week. Of course, with that comes scaling challenges. But it's all part of the fun.
We have a great team and a great environment that focuses on customers and product development. I get to collaborate with product / UX / support people day to day to build a product that meets a real business need, and makes everyone happy. But when I just need to bang out some code, people leave me alone. Work / life balance is great. Bureaucracy is at a minimum.
More about our stack / team here: <a href="http://engineering.custommade.com" rel="nofollow">http://engineering.custommade.com</a>
You're a programmer who has pushed code to production innumerable times, and doesn't cringe at the prospect of collaborating with a team of non-techies every so often. You know the modern web stack well, and specialize in at least one part of it.
